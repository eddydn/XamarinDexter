======


Dexter is an Xamarin Android library binding from original Android Dexter that simplifies the process of requesting permissions at runtime.

Android Marshmallow includes a new functionality to let users grant or deny permissions when running an app instead of granting them all when installing it. This approach gives the user more control over applications but requires developers to add lots of code to support it.

The official API is heavily coupled with the ``Activity`` class.
Dexter frees your permission code from your activities and lets you write that logic anywhere you want.
